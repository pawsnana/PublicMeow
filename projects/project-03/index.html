    <p class="info_title"> Akali </p>
    <p class="info_subitle"> True Damage </p>
    <p class="info_role"> Rapper</p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="info_description"> 
        Akali, the dynamic ninja rapper from K/DA, voiced by (G)i-dle's Soyeon, captivates again with her neon outfit and striking performance. Her scene-stealing rap, delivered in Korean, shines under neon lights, quickly endearing her to fans and highlighting her as a central figure of K/DA's show. </p>
</div>

    <p class="info_title"> Ekko </p>
    <p class="info_subitle"> True Damage </p>
    <p class="info_role"> Rapper</p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="info_description"> Ekko, traditionally an inventive kid from League of Legends' gritty Zaun city, truly stands out in True Damage's show. His portrayal by Duckwrth and Thutmose, both renowned for their work on the "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse" soundtrack, adds a dynamic edge to his character, elevating his presence. </p>
</div>

<div id="content_icon_senna_TD" class="icon-content hidden">
    <p class="info_title"> Senna </p>
    <p class="info_subitle"> True Damage </p>
    <p class="info_role"> Lead Vocalist</p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="info_description"> Senna, a character who defied her fate in a demon's lantern, is voiced by Keke Palmer. In the lore, once trapped by Thresh in a lantern and haunted by the Black Mist, she emerged transformed, mastering both darkness and light. Now, she combats the Mist with her relic weapon, liberating lost souls with each blast. </p>
</div>

<div id="content_icon_qiyana_TD" class="icon-content hidden">
    <p class="info_title"> Qiyana </p>
    <p class="info_subitle"> True Damage </p>
    <p class="info_role"> Lead Vocalist</p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="info_description"> Qiyana, the elemental assassin with a ring blade, comes to life through Latin pop star Becky G's voice. Sporting a special Louis Vuitton outfit, a unique collaboration between Riot Games and the luxury brand, she dazzles in the video.

<div id="content_icon_yasuo_TD" class="icon-content hidden">
    <p class="info_title"> Yasuo </p>
    <p class="info_subitle"> True Damage </p>
    <p class="info_role"> DJ</p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="info_description"> Yasuo, traditionally a wind-commanding samurai, takes on the role of the group's DJ, silently contributing to the ensemble. Deeply principled and skilled, this Ionian swordsman faced turmoil, being wrongly accused of his master's murder and tragically confronting his own brother. Despite finding truth and redemption, he continues his journey, guided only by the wind. </p>
</div>


<div id="content_icon_morgana_SG" class="icon-content hidden">
    <p class="info_title"> Morgana </p>
    <p class="info_subitle"> Star Guardian </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="info_description"> A mysterious villainess who claims to be an envoy from dark space, Morgana sends monsters rampaging through Valoran City in an attempt to force Akali to fall, fragmenting the Star Guardians and allowing her to destroy them one by one. Convinced that justice and goodness are immutable, single-minded ideas that don’t properly respect the darkness of the universe, she seeks to snuff them out entirely... along with anyone who gets in her way. </p>
</div>

<div id="content_icon_syndra_SG" class="icon-content hidden">
    <p class="info_title"> Syndra </p>
    <p class="info_subitle"> Star Guardian </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="info_description"> Feared and admired, Syndra is a formidable Star Guardian from an earlier era. Like Janna, her history is cloaked in shadow, but it’s clear as day that she is an ambitious warrior who is quick to dismiss those she deems unworthy of her time. Currently, she acts as an advisor on Ahri’s team, guiding them away from unforeseen dangers and toward a promising future. Despite Ahri’s trust in her, some members have questioned the veteran’s true motives and suspect there is no price that Syndra won’t pay to achieve her personal goals. </p>
</div>

<div id="content_icon_zoe_SG" class="icon-content hidden">
    <p class="info_title"> Zoe </p>
    <p class="info_subitle"> Star Guardian </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="info_description"> A member of the ancient, first group of Star Guardians, Zoe’s heart desired not love, but chaos - twisting her newfound power into a malignant expression of cosmic madness. After numberless eons of hunting the First Star’s chosen, she has finally come to Valoran City, hoping to destroy the latest generation of Guardians as she has countless others. </p>
</div>

<div id="content_icon_lulu_SG" class="icon-content hidden">
    <p class="info_title"> Lulu </p>
    <p class="info_subitle"> Star Guardian </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="info_description"> The youngest member of Lux’s team, Lulu is an odd but gifted second-year at Valoran High School. Her unique relationship with the Starlight, the source of every Star Guardian’s power, lets her communicate with it like a close companion. To Lulu, this inner world is the most wondrous place, and anything outside of it is not as interesting. Because of her fascination with the Starlight, outwardly she may appear unconcerned with the gravity of her responsibilities. This whimsical behavior is puzzling to some teammates, but they accept her and all her eccentricities.  </p>
</div>

<div id="content_icon_lux_SG" class="icon-content hidden">
    <p class="info_title"> Lux </p>
    <p class="info_subitle"> Star Guardian </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="info_description"> Cheerful, courageous, and just a bit clumsy, Lux shines the brightest among her Star Guardian team as its captain. While young and inexperienced compared to teammates like Janna, the pink-haired teen’s optimism inspires others in the face of an unkind—but in her eyes, noble—destiny. Protecting the universe is a responsibility that Lux is committed to, even if she doesn’t fully realize the gravity of it just yet. There are many challenges ahead on her journey to becoming a strong leader worthy of the First Star’s call. For now, Lux truly believes that as long as they fight together, there is no darkness they can’t overcome. </p>
</div>

<div id="content_icon_xayah_SG" class="icon-content hidden">
    <p class="info_title"> Xayah </p>
    <p class="info_subitle"> Star Guardian </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="info_description"> Abandoned by her captain and teammates, Xayah spent years in darkness. She sought revenge—yet deep down, she only wanted an explanation, an answer as to why Ahri left Rakan and her to die. Xayah pursued her former friends across the galaxy until, during the Battle of the Twilight Star, Rakan sacrificed his own light to purge the darkness in Xayah's soul. Now a Star Guardian once more, Xayah searches the night skies for her love. She hopes to return the favor and bring him back to the light, but to do so, she must battle the darkness that still rages inside. Xayah's love is her guiding force—though she'd never admit to something so horribly sentimental.

</div>

<div id="content_icon_ahri_SG" class="icon-content hidden">
    <p class="info_title"> Ahri </p>
    <p class="info_subitle"> Star Guardian </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="info_description"> Ahri is a charismatic captain who leads a team of both new and veteran Star Guardians, from the outer edges of the cosmos. Having experienced the pain of losing teammates in the line of duty, she is viciously protective of her “family,” and a strong desire burns within her to ensure no one she cares for ever fades away again. These events have also shaped how she approaches other teams and their captains, especially the less experienced ones like Lux. There’s no more room for patience and understanding in her universe—tough love is all that’s left. Though that be the case, none are immune to Ahri’s own unique charms. </p>
</div>

<div id="content_icon_akali_SG" class="icon-content hidden">
    <p class="info_title"> Akali </p>
    <p class="info_subitle"> Star Guardian </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="info_description"> A street-smart, gregarious city girl with an upbeat attitude, Akali's life is turned upside-down by the appearance of the Star Guardians... and the destruction that follows them. Taking the oath alongside her best friend Kai'Sa, she stands against the enemies of the First Star with finely honed reflexes and an array of powerful Guardian weapons. Can friendship drown out the doubt in her heart, or will Akali be the first of the new generation to fall? </p>

Ahri’s sleek new look attracts top fashion designers. During fashion week, Ahri graces runways around the world in finale gowns.

    <br><br>
    <p class="info_description"> Eve’s reputation paints her as a demanding diva. She told Pop Shine, “I’m an artist, not a socialite. I won’t apologize for high standards.” Eve once walked off the stage of a live performance when her vocals were backed by an audio track she didn’t approve. Though her presence in the industry is turbulent, she has a diehard fan base who call themselves “Deeva.” Prior to K/DA, Evelynn released two hit singles, Agony’s Embrace and Ecstasy. </p>
